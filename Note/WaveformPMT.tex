\section{Waveform of PMT} % (fold)
PMT is a device which is highly sensitive to even single photon. Therefore, PMT is widely used in neutrino experiments based on liquid and dark matter experiment. In neutrino experiments, liquid scintillator emits light after excited by candidate particles and charged particles emit Cherenkov light in liquid.
