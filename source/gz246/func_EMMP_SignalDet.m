% this file will generate the answer table from the EMMP (expectation
% maximization matching pursuit) algorithm;

% target_file: the filename(with path) from which signals are to be detected;
% training_file: a training file from which template of unit pulse response
% can be estimated;
% output_file: the name of the file to which answer table containg the position and weight for the
% detected signals can be writen.  
% Output variable:
% awtable: A table structure that contains the positions and weights for
% the signals detected. 
% Example: [awtable] = my_answer_v4();

% target_file = 'D:\proj_signalDetection\zincm-problem.h5';
